# Studentapp
This project is a backend-only system designed to manage student information using Java and MySQL. The application performs CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—on student data stored in a MySQL database named students, within a table called student.
It uses JDBC for database connectivity and PreparedStatement to ensure secure query execution.
The goal is to provide a structured backend setup that can be expanded into a full-stack application later, or integrated with any frontend system for student management.
